How to Avoid This Error in the Future
The root of the problem was a conflict between the modern build tool (Vite) and the manual configuration for Tailwind.

Vite is Smart: Modern tools like Vite have built-in, optimized support for PostCSS (the tool that runs Tailwind). When Vite sees a tailwind.config.js file, it automatically knows how to configure PostCSS correctly for you.
The Conflict: Our mistake was creating a postcss.config.js file manually. This forced Vite to stop its automatic process and try to obey our manual file. Because the file was for a slightly older version of Tailwind, it caused the error.
The Lesson: When using an integrated build tool like Vite or Next.js, always follow their specific guide for adding Tailwind. Trust the tool's automation and avoid creating manual configuration files unless the official guide explicitly tells you to.
Here is the simplified, future-proof process for Vite + Tailwind:

* Create your Vite project: npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
* Install Tailwind's dependencies: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
* The Key Step: Run the init command without the -p flag: npx tailwindcss init
* This command correctly creates only the tailwind.config.js file and avoids the problematic postcss.config.js.
* Configure the content path in tailwind.config.js.
* Add the @tailwind directives to your src/index.css file.
That's it. By omitting the -p flag and not creating the PostCSS file, you let Vite handle the setup, which prevents the conflict.
