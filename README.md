## üìú About The Project

Study Squad was born from the vision of creating a more connected and dynamic online educational experience. It's a full-stack web application designed to empower educators and inspire learners. Unlike traditional platforms, Study Squad provides teachers with their own customizable "Studios" where they can build their brand, publish multi-format courses, and foster a community. For students, it's a world of knowledge to explore, with a rich community forum and the ability to connect with teachers directly through real-time video calls.

This project was developed as a final portfolio project for Holberton School, showcasing a wide range of full-stack development skills, from backend architecture to modern frontend user experience.
